mmtests
=======

MM run by typing:
c:\path\to\ContinuousTests.exe c:\path\to\mmtests.sln

Win7 x64
MM v.1.0.45

No additional config file except for AutoTest.TestRunner[.x86][.v4.0].exe.config (copied over to cfg dir from MM dir, but not used explicitly)

The line below from log file suggests that I may need some .config entries that I don't have:
00:31:26.015 - handling warning NUnit test runner not specified. NUnit tests will not be run.
